### Project Description
Mood Mismatcher is a web application designed to provide users with the worst advice based on their current mood to make them feel even worse. The app fetches mood-related advice from a Google Sheet using a RESTful API.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever felt too good about yourself? Mood Mismatcher addresses the "problem" of too much positivity by offering terrible advice that will help you embrace your gloomy side.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution? Deliver hilariously bad advice tailored to your mood, ensuring that you leave feeling even worse! With the added excitement of emoji rain, we make feeling miserable fun!
